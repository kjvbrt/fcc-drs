# FCC Dataset Request System

A web-based dataset request tracking system for centrally produced datasets
used in analysis, detector design studies, and other physics related areas at
the [Future Circular Collider (FCC)](https://fcc.web.cern.ch/).

FCC-DRS keeps an eye on the dataset needs of the community around the FCC and makes
sure nothing falls through the cracks.

## Features

- **Submit requests** for FCC datasets with HEP-specific fields (dataset stage, use case, format, tags)
- **Track status** through the full pipeline: Draft → Pending Review → Approved → In Progress → Completed
- **Priority levels** — Low, Medium, High, Critical — with dashboard alerts for critical requests
- **Pipeline view** for managers: assignment, batch actions, inline status and priority overrides
- **Activity log** per request: comments, internal manager notes, system events with timestamps
- **Assignment** of requests to managers with dropdown selector
- **Batch actions** — approve, reject, complete, or move to in-progress across multiple requests at once
- **Filter & search** by status, priority, or free text
- **Bento-style dashboard** with live stats (total, pending, in-progress, completed)
- **Markdown + LaTeX math** rendering in titles and descriptions (KaTeX + marked.js)
- **Email notifications** on status changes (optional, via SMTP)
- **Dark / light / system** theme with persistent preference
- **Responsive design** — works on desktop and mobile

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.22 or later

### Local development (dev mode)

CERN SSO is bypassed in dev mode. A simple form lets you pick any username and role — no credentials required.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kjvbrt/fcc-drs
cd fcc-drs
DEV_MODE=TRUE go run ./cmd/fcc-drs
```

Open **http://localhost:5050**, enter a username, choose a role (requester or manager), and log in.

### Build

```bash
# Development build (SQLite)
go build -o fcc-drs ./cmd/fcc-drs

# Production build (PostgreSQL — for CERN PaaS deployment)
go build -tags prod -o fcc-drs ./cmd/fcc-drs
```

### Front-end assets

All JS/CSS dependencies (HTMX, Tailwind CSS, KaTeX, marked, Inter font) are self-hosted under `static/vendor/`. To download them and regenerate the compiled Tailwind CSS:

```bash
./scripts/download-assets.sh
```

Run this once after cloning and again whenever you modify templates (Tailwind only includes classes it finds in the templates).

> **TODO:** Replace the Tailwind CLI build step with hand-crafted utility classes in `style.css`, eliminating the build dependency entirely.

The server starts on **http://localhost:5050**. The SQLite database is created automatically at `./data/requests.db` on first run (dev mode only).

### Email notifications (optional)

Set the following environment variables to enable email notifications on status changes:

```bash
export SMTP_HOST=smtp.cern.ch
export SMTP_PORT=587
export SMTP_USER=your-username
export SMTP_PASS=your-password
export SMTP_FROM=fcc-drs@cern.ch
```

If not set, email is silently disabled.

## Authentication & Roles

Authentication uses **CERN SSO** (Keycloak / OpenID Connect). Requester identity (name, username, email) is always taken from SSO and cannot be edited by users.

| Role          | Permissions |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Requester** | Submit requests, view all requests, edit own requests while draft or pending, add comments |
| **Manager**   | Everything above + change status/priority on any request, assign requests, delete requests, batch actions, internal notes |

Role assignment:
- CERN usernames listed in `MANAGER_USERNAMES` receive the **manager** role on first login
- All other authenticated users receive the **requester** role
- Roles are stored in the local database and persist across logins

## Deployment (CERN PaaS / OpenShift)

FCC-DRS runs on [CERN PaaS](https://paas.cern.ch) (OpenShift) with a PostgreSQL database provided by the [CERN DBOD](https://dbod.web.cern.ch) service.

### Prerequisites

- A CERN OpenShift project (`oc login` access)
- A PostgreSQL instance provisioned via CERN DBOD
- Application registered at the [CERN Application Portal](https://application-portal.web.cern.ch) to obtain an OIDC client ID and secret

### 1. Build and push the container image

The production build uses the `prod` build tag, which enables PostgreSQL and disables SQLite.

```bash
docker build -t gitlab-registry.cern.ch/<your-group>/fcc-drs:latest .
docker push gitlab-registry.cern.ch/<your-group>/fcc-drs:latest
```

Update `openshift/deployment.yaml` with your image path.

### 2. Fill in secrets

Edit `openshift/secret.yaml` with your actual credentials (do **not** commit this file with real values):

```yaml
stringData:
  database-url: "postgresql://user:password@dbod-host.cern.ch:5432/database?sslmode=require"
  oidc-client-id: "your-client-id"
  oidc-client-secret: "your-client-secret"
  oidc-redirect-url: "https://fcc-drs.web.cern.ch/auth/callback"
```

Edit `openshift/configmap.yaml` with the CERN usernames that should have the manager role:

```yaml
data:
  manager-usernames: "jsmith,adoe"
```

Edit `openshift/route.yaml` and replace `REPLACE_WITH_HOSTNAME` with your actual hostname (e.g. `fcc-drs.web.cern.ch`).

### 3. Apply the manifests

```bash
oc apply -f openshift/secret.yaml
oc apply -f openshift/configmap.yaml
oc apply -f openshift/deployment.yaml
oc apply -f openshift/service.yaml
oc apply -f openshift/route.yaml
```

### 4. Verify

```bash
oc get pods        # pod should reach Running state
oc get route fcc-drs   # shows the public URL
oc logs -f deployment/fcc-drs  # tail logs
```

The database schema is created automatically on first startup. No manual migration step is required.

## ToDo

* Validation plots generation
* MC Generator Card upload
* Extensions:
  * Extend the existing production (number of events)
  * Continue along the event processing chain
  * Extend number of targeted detectors
* Add Accelerator
* Field to specify detector option and version
* Make campaign and Key4hep stack drop down, where one of them is required to be
    specified
* versioning
* Clean up stale mention relations on request edit (currently mentions are only added, never removed if a `#N` reference is deleted from description or notes)
* do not allow scrolling of underlying web page when modal is active
* implement info button or whole wiki section on how to request a dataset, what
    is the planned production schedule and so on.
* Maybe add a banner informing about the next campaign?
* Rename manager role to coordinator
